- 👋 Hi, I’m @TastelessOne
- 👀 I’m interested in whatever has caught my attention most immediately.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I basically don't know shit. I've been using computers since my first Apple ][ and playing games since Infocom was a new thing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to keep the boredom away, but I don't know why you'd want me to do that.
- 📫 How to reach me? On this site? Whatever is the usual way.
